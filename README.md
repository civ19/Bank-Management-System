* A main menu
* Deposit
* Withdraw
* Transferring Money
* Account Balance

## Instructions on how to use this project properly
- Immediately upon running the executable, you will be greeted with a main menu asking for your name and your PIN. The PIN can be anything you want to set it as, but it has to be 4 digits. Otherwise, it won't let you login.
- When you've gotten past that, you'll be given 4 options. You will have a chequing account, and a sum of money assigned to you. From here on out, you can choose 4 options: Deposit, withdraw, transferring, or exit.
- These options will be numbered. To choose an option, enter the number of the assigned option. For example, you'd enter '1' if you want to deposit money.
- After you deposit or withdraw etc, it will send a confirmation message and immediately close the window to signify that the action is complete.
- For the transfer option, you will have to enter the information it asks you for, then it will send a confirmation message and close the window after its successful.
